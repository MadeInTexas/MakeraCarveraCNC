# How To Double Your Work Area / Machine Oversized Stock

## *Need more work area to cut your design?*  
## *Donâ€™t want to buy a bigger machine?*  
### **This guide will show you how to effectively double the work area of your Carvera CNC.**  
#### *NOTE: This workaround MAY be possible with the Carvera Air CNC, but it has not been explored.*  

## ITEMS NEEDED
1. XYZ Probe (included with Carvera CNC)
2. Carvera Controller Software: v0.9.11 (included on Makera's official website)
    - There is a community version of the Carvera Controller, but the work around has not been tested for that Controller, yet.
3. Masking Tape
4. Hot Glue Sticks
5. Hot Glue Gun
6. That's it!  

## PROCEDURE
### **Step #1 Ensure stock falls within dimensions of 360mm (x) x 240mm (y) x 140mm (z)**  
  
**IMPORTANT**: Technically, the stock has a maximum dimensional limit of **359mm (x) x 479mm (y) x 140mm (z)**  
- This is to ensure proper usage of the XYZ Probe, but more on this later.  

### **Step #2 Design your part in Computer-Aided Design (CAD) and process the design in Computer-Aided Manufacturing (CAM)**  

**IMPORTANT**: In your CAM software, ensure that the work origin is set to the TOP LEFT corner of your chosen stock.

**NOTE**: This specific How-To assumes that you have basic knowledge of CAD/CAM, and will NOT go into depth on best practices
regarding design.  
However, I am currently working on a quick-start guide for this, and will eventually include it in this repository.

### **Step #3 Adhere stock to the Carvera Bed**  
  
- Step #3a: Place masking tape to the back of your stock and to the bed of the Carvera.
- Step #3b: Place your chosen glue to top of the masking tape of the bed.
- Step #3c: Align the masking tape placed on the stock to the masking tape placed on the bed, and then sandwich the glue between the two.

**IMPORTANT**: During Step #3c, use the side of the Automatic Tool Changer (ATC) as a make-shift straight edge to help properly align your stock whilst adhering it to the bed.  
**NOTE**: This How-To will not go into depth on specific glues/masking tape to use.  
The most beginner-friendly and budget-friendly option I have found specifically for the Carvera would be to use:  
**Sctoch Beige 2in Wide Masking Tape**  
**Gorilla Glue Sticks**  
**Bauer Hot Glue Gun**  
Details on this choice will be explored in a separate file in this repository.
              
### **Step #4 Use the manual XYZ Probe**  

[START HERE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNCbZI0ndpA&list=PL7zu0ucQCuYRTigCJ4nqRrI0TIhcHHbZl&index=8) if you've never used the XYZ Probe before, then return to Step #4a.

- Step #4a: Connect and orient your XYZ Probe to sit flush against the top LEFT corner of your stock.  
- Step #4b: Move the tool head (with the correct tool) until it is hovering over the center of the XYZ Probe.
- Step #4c: Connect the magnetic wire head to the tool head.
- Step #4d: Select your NC Program, and then run the XYZ Probe command from the Config Menu.  
- Step #4e: Once the XYZ Probe command has been completed, exit the File window, and reopen the window to view changes in the stock origin.  
- Step #4f: Take note of the current Offset from Anchor 1 that is displayed.
- Step #4g: Once the measured Offsets from the XYZ probe are recorded, go to the Manual Offset Input page.
- Step #4h: Re-Enter the recorded X-Offset as noted.
- Step #4i: Re-Enter the Y-Offset **BUT add 50mm to that value first BEFORE inputting the value**.
    - The XYZ Probe command touches off in the -Y direction. To correct the machine, and tell it that the edge of the material  
        is actually in the opposite direction, we must add 50mm to the Y-Offset since that is the Edge-Edge distance of the XYZ Probe

### **Step #5 THAT'S IT!!!**
Now, you can run your program to process the 1st half of the stock.  

**IMPORTANT**: Keep the lid of the Carvera **OPEN AT ALL TIMES** during the program. Your stock may run into the inside of the lid if it is closed, which could lead to stock detachment from the bed.  
  
**NOTE**: Ensure that the dust collection is turned on and functioning properly to ensure minimal spread of particulates. Using a particulate filtering mask while staying next to the machine during operation is reccomended.  

## OTHER CONSIDERATIONS  
  
1. You will have to process the stock twice if your design calls for it. Once the first pass has been completed, rotate your stock 180 degrees along the Z-Axis and repeat steps #3 - #5.  
2. This guide does not address the use of Alignment Pins. Using Alignment Pins is the proper way to ensure that your workpiece is oriented correctly for your NC Program, and you can learn more via [Austin Shaner's Fusion 350 Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPMvnzmuTOw&list=PL6PhF5oGQvMYJliRKBzRqKd98M4RR_gr1) on YouTube! This is a very beginner-friendly course and one I would reccomend you watch if it's your first time with CNC. It's the one that I used personally to understand Fusion360's CAM.  
3. If your stock is too large, the XYZ probe may not work. Since the XYZ Probe requires the movement of the tool head to touch off on the inner edges of the probe, stock that is too large or is hanging off the side of the bed will trigger the limit switches of the Carvera in the X-Y direction. That is why the maximum dimensional limit of your stock should be no larger than **359mm (x) x 479mm (y) x 140mm (z)**. This is to ensure that there is enough space for the Carvera tool head to touch off on the probe prior to activating the limit switches.
