# Quick Start Guide to Carvera CNC with Fusion360

## ASSUMPTIONS

### This How-To assumes that the Carvera CNC and Fusion360 is your first introduction to subtractive manufacturing and Computer Aided Manufacturing (CAM) software, respectively.

### This How-To also assumes that you have basic Computer Aided Design (CAD) experience. Whether if it's from a formal class or informal hobbyist 3D printing, this guide assumes that you have done an extrude before, so we won't be going over that. 

### This guide is focused on bringing your CAD 3D model into Fusion60 CAM to be carved by the Carvera.
  
#### Aside from that, **no information will be left out, and you won't be left behind!**  

## STEP #1: EQUIPMENT  
1. Carvera CNC (this guide could likely also be used for the Carvera Air, but it has not been formally tested on that model, yet).
2. Personal Computer (PC)
3. **optional* 3D-Printer

## STEP #2:
