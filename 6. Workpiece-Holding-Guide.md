# Workpiece Holding Guide - Comparison of Glues and Tapes

Tape
Summary: I would reccomend buying the Beige Scotch Tape. Their non-adhesive backing seems to be more porous and less "shiny" which give the impression (and anecdotal report) that it allows for better adhesion to all of the tested liquid adhesives.

Glue
Summary: For general purpose and non-strict tolerance projects, I would reccomend Gorilla Hot Glue Sticks. While this does not result in the flatest bed adhesion, the Carvera Auto Bed Leveling compensates for this enough to result in even final passes. For projects that require precision or are very agressive with cuts, I would reccomend using Loctite Super Glue. That being said, I have used Gorilla Hot Glue Sticks with a 1/4" bit and the rgidity of the machine gave out first before the glue. That is why I am confident in saying that the Gorilla Hot Glue sticks are more than enough for the Carvera specifically.
