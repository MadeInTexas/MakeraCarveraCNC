# How To Double Your Work Area / Machine Oversized Stock
Makera Carvera Controller Version: v0.9.11

## Summary:
*Need more work area to cut your design?*  
*Donâ€™t want to buy a bigger machine?*  
**This guide will show you how to effectively double the work area of your Carvera and Carvera Air CNC.**  

## Items Needed:
1. XYZ Probe (included with Carvera and Carvera Air CNC)
2. Original (Manufacturer's Carvera Controller)
    - There is a community version of the Carvera Controller, but the work around has not been tested for that Controller
3. That's it!

**Step #1**
**Ensure stock falls within dimensions of **360mm (x) x 240mm (y) x 140mm (z)**  
IMPORTANT: Technically, the stock has a maximum dimensional limit of **359mm (x) x 479mm (y) x 140mm (z)**  
        - This is to ensure proper usage of the XYZ Probe, but more on this later.
