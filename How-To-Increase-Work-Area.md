# How To Double Your Work Area / Machine Oversized Stock
Makera Carvera Controller Version: v0.9.11

## Summary:
*Need more work area to cut your design?*  
*Donâ€™t want to buy a bigger machine?*  
**This guide will show you how to effectively double the work area of your Carvera CNC.**  
*NOTE: This workaround MAY be possible with the Carvera Air CNC, but it has not been explored.*  

## Items Needed:
1. XYZ Probe (included with Carvera CNC)
2. Carvera Controller Software (included on Makera's official website)
    - There is a community version of the Carvera Controller, but the work around has not been tested for that Controller.
3. That's it!  


## Process-Breakdown:
### **Step #1 Ensure stock falls within dimensions of 360mm (x) x 240mm (y) x 140mm (z)**  
IMPORTANT: Technically, the stock has a maximum dimensional limit of **359mm (x) x 479mm (y) x 140mm (z)**  
- This is to ensure proper usage of the XYZ Probe, but more on this later.  

### **Step #2 Design your part in Computer-Aided Design (CAD) and process the design in Computer-Aided Manufacturing (CAM)**
IMPORTANT: This specific How-To assumes that you have basic knowledge of CAD/CAM, and will NOT go into depth on best practices  
regarding design. However, I am currently working on a quick-start guide for this, and will eventually include it in this repository.

### **Step #3 Adhere stock to the Carvera Bed**
IMPORTANT: Use the side of the Automatic Tool Changer (ATC) as a make-shift straight edge to properly align your stock.  
- Next, use double-sided tape or masking tape/liquid adhesive to affix your stock to the bed.
        NOTE: This How-To will not go into depth on specific adhering methods. However, a separate file
              will be created to explore the results of different adhering methods.
              
### **Step #4 Use the XYZ Probe on the Top Left of your Stock**
