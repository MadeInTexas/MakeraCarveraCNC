# How To Double Your Work Area / Machine Oversized Stock
Makera Carvera Controller Version: v0.9.11

## Summary:
*Need more work area to cut your design?*  
*Donâ€™t want to buy a bigger machine?*  
**This guide will show you how to effectively double the work area of your Carvera CNC.**  
*NOTE: This workaround MAY be possible with the Carvera Air CNC, but it has not been explored*

## Items Needed:
1. XYZ Probe (included with Carvera CNC)
2. Original (Manufacturer's Carvera Controller)
    - There is a community version of the Carvera Controller, but the work around has not been tested for that Controller
3. That's it!

**Step #1 Ensure stock falls within dimensions of 360mm (x) x 240mm (y) x 140mm (z)**  
IMPORTANT: Technically, the stock has a maximum dimensional limit of **359mm (x) x 479mm (y) x 140mm (z)**  
        - This is to ensure proper usage of the XYZ Probe, but more on this later.  

**Step #2 Design your part in Computer-Aided Design (CAD) and process the design in Computer-Aided Manufacturing (CAM)**
IMPORTANT: This specific How-To assumes that you have basic knowledge of CAD/CAM,  
            and will NOT go into depth on best practices regarding design. However,
            I am currently working on a quick-start guide for this, and will eventually 
            include it in this repository.

**Step #3 Adhere stock to the Carvera Bed**
IMPORTANT: Use the Automatic Tool Changer (ATC)
